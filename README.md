RDF::LDP
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-rdf/rdf-ldp.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-rdf/rdf-ldp)

This software ships with the following libraries:

  - `RDF::LDP` --- contains the domain model for LDP Resources.
  - `Rack::LDP` --- a suite of Rack middleware for creating LDP servers based on
  `RDF::LDP`.
  - Lamprey --- a basic LDP server implemented with `Rack::LDP`.

Lamprey
=======

Lamprey is a basic LDP server. To start it, use:

```
bundle exec ruby app/lamprey.rb

# At v0.3.0, and after, do:

gem install rdf-ldp
lamprey
```

An `ldp:BasicContainer` will be created at the address of your first
`GET` request. Note that if that request is made to the server root,
Sinatra will assume a trailing slash.

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:4567

Rack::LDP
==========

Setting up a Custom Server with Rackup
---------------------------------------

You can quickly create your own server with any framework supporting [Rack](https://github.com/rack/). The simplest way to do this is with [Rackup](https://github.com/rack/rack/wiki/(tutorial)-rackup-howto).

```ruby
# ./config.ru

require 'rack/ldp'

use Rack::LDP::ContentNegotiation
use Rack::LDP::Errors
use Rack::LDP::Responses
use Rack::LDP::Requests

# Setup a repository and an initial container:
#
#   - You probably want some persistent repository implementation. The example uses an in-memory repository.
#   - You may not need an initial "base" container, if you handle create on PUT requests.
#
repository = RDF::Repository.new 
RDF::LDP::Container.new(RDF::URI('http://localhost:9292/'), repository)
  .create('', 'text/plain') if repository.empty?

app = proc do |env|
  [200, {}, RDF::LDP::Resource.find(RDF::URI(env['REQUEST_URI']), repository)]
end

run app
```

Compliance
----------

Current compliance reports for Lamprey are located in [/reports](reports/).
Reports are generated by the LDP test suite. To duplicate the results,
use the `testsuite` branch, which contains a work-around for
[w3c/ldp-testsuite#224](https://github.com/w3c/ldp-testsuite/issues/224).
